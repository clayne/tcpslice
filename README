TCPSLICE 1.1
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Network Research Group
tcpdump@ee.lbl.gov
ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpslice.tar.Z

This directory contains source code for tcpslice, a tool for extracting
portions of packet trace files generated using tcpdump's -w flag. The
original distribution is available via anonymous ftp to ftp.ee.lbl.gov,
in tcpslice.tar.Z.

Tcpslice uses libpcap, a system-independent interface for user-level
packet capture.  Before building tcpslice, you must first retrieve and
build libpcap, also from LBL, in:

	ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z

Once libpcap is built (either install it or make sure it's in ../libpcap),
you can build tcpslice using the procedure in the INSTALL file.

Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code contributions,
etc., should be sent to the email address "tcpslice@ee.lbl.gov".
